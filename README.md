# Slack clone
Demo: https://zh47.herokuapp.com

Stack:
- React
- Socket.io
- Express
- Node.js
- MongoDB

I didn't use any state container (like Redux) yet, but it might be useful in the future to avoid passing data between components.

## User stories
- Users can choose a nickname
- Users can join chatrooms of their own choosing
- Users can send messages to other users

## Features
- Mobile-friendly UI (Material-UI)
- Stores messages on the server (only messages from channels are saved at the moment, but it's quite easy to extend it to support private messages also)
- Supports multiple logged clients at the same time from one user (e.g. desktop & mobile clients)
- Authentication is made with Passport.js which makes other sign up methods easy to implement (e.g. Facebook OAuth)
- Highlights unread conversations
- Keeps list of online users in real time

## Install & run
The server includes webpack-dev-middleware & webpack-hot-middleware to show code changes on browser

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing (Mocha & Chai)
Most of the real time and routes api are covered in the tests.

```
npm test
```

## Coverage report (Istanbul)
Coverage report can be generated by running
```
npm run coverage
```

## Linting (ESlint)
```
npm run lint
```
to fix most of the warnings automatically:
```
npm run lint:fix
```
