## User stories
- Users can choose a nickname
- Users can join chatrooms of their own choosing
- Users can send messages to other users

## Features
- Mobile-friendly UI (Material-UI)
- Stores messages on the server (only messages from channels are saved at the moment, but it's quite easy to extend it to support private messages also)
- Supports multiple logged clients at the same time from one user (e.g. desktop & mobile clients)
- Authentication is made with Passport.js which makes other sign up methods easy to implement (e.g. Facebook OAuth)
- Highlights unread conversations

npm start
```
